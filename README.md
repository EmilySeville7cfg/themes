Themes.

## Current goals :checkered_flag:

- Update all themes to support all [v2.7.0 syntax](https://github.com/command-line-interface-pages/syntax/blob/main/base.md)
  features like placeholder prefixes and suffixes

## Quick introduction :rocket:

To get help for `cat` command with default theme type `clip-view cat`. If you need a more beautiful
output you can use [this](https://github.com/command-line-interface-pages/themes/tree/main/awesome)
theme like this: `clip-view --theme awesome cat`

Theme is a YAML file itself.

## Writing themes :hammer_and_wrench:
